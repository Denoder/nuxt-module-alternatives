**Information**

This will only work with pinia, I had originally had it work with vuex, but since that is in maintenece mode, I decided to switch to pinia. 
The middleware is a little buggy I believe, but please do tell me if you find any bugs. I have also disabled the auto redirect upon logging in, for now you need to manually
redirect when you successfuly log in until I fix it.

Again if you find any bugs please do tell me, I'm still working on this.
